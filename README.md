## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle and Boston Airbnb data to answer the following questions:

1. The vibe of each city neighborhood can be described using listing descriptions?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit each city? By how much do prices spike?
3. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to each city?
4. Is any difference in the Airbnb ratings among the cities?
5. What characteristics define a good rate to the host?

The data was gathered from the following links:

1. Seattle Airbnb data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle
2. Boston Airbnb data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one (1) notebook that has the data cience process and the analysis followed to answer the questions above. This file is named "FinalProjectIntroduction.ipynb".

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@andrecezu/airbnb-data-analysis-37cf7c785011).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle links that appear in the project motivation section.  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
