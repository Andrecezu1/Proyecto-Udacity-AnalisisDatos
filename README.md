## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle and Boston Airbnb data to answer the following questions:

1. The vibe of each city neighborhood can be described using listing descriptions?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit each city? By how much do prices spike?
3. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to each city?
4. Is any difference in the Airbnb ratings among the cities?
5. What characteristics define a good rate to the host?

The data was gathered from the following links:

1. Seattle Airbnb data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle
2. Boston Airbnb data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
